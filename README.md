# Books-recommendation-system
This project recommends books similar to **"On the Origin of Species"** by Charles Darwin using techniques from **Natural Language Processing** and python pandas. By this project, very potential book recommender system can be made to predict the books that are similar to one specific book. It helps the users to get the similar kinds of books according to their preferences.


This is done through the use of Natural Language Processing and scikit-learn libraries along with python pandas. Amazing examples of recommender systems include **Netflix recommendation, amazon product recommendations, and instagram ads, et cetera**, are all based on Machine learning, NLP techniques. Here, the similar book recommender system is built using NLP.


# Recommender systems:
Recommender systems are those that are built using machine learning and NLP techniques which are used to identify user's interest and predict similar products that seeks users interest. There are two approaches in making recommender systems: [collaborative filtering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recommender_system) and [content-based filtering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recommender_system).


# Natural Language Processing:
Natural Language Processing is the automatic manipulation of the natural language such as text or speech by the software. There are many challenges in solving natural language processing problems. These are all solved by the advanced machine learning techniques, otherwise called as **Deep Learning** approaches. Some of the examples of applications of Natural Language Processing includes fake news detection, sentiment analysis, IBM cognitive assistant, voice-driven interfaces like Amazon Alexa and so on.

The major terms involved in NLP includes:
1. [Bag of words](https://towardsdatascience.com/your-guide-to-natural-language-processing-nlp-48ea2511f6e1)
2. [Tokenization](https://towardsdatascience.com/your-guide-to-natural-language-processing-nlp-48ea2511f6e1)
3. [Stop words removal](https://towardsdatascience.com/your-guide-to-natural-language-processing-nlp-48ea2511f6e1)
4. [Stemming](https://towardsdatascience.com/your-guide-to-natural-language-processing-nlp-48ea2511f6e1)
5. [Lemmatization](https://towardsdatascience.com/your-guide-to-natural-language-processing-nlp-48ea2511f6e1)
6. [Topic modeling](https://towardsdatascience.com/your-guide-to-natural-language-processing-nlp-48ea2511f6e1)

Using these above approaches, this project is developed to identify the similar books correctly.
